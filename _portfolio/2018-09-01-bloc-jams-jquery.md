# Summary

  A music player written with JavaScript and jQuery

# Explanation

  This is the first and simplest iteration of Bloc Jams.

  Streams audio, via [Buzz audio](http://buzz.jaysalvat.com/), songs that are located on the site. The application is just one screen: a single album with five songs.

  To choose a song, click on the song name or click on the next/previous buttons under the list of songs. A song must be playing for these buttons to work.

  To pause a song, click on the song's pause button, or the pause button at the bottom.

  You may track to a different place in the song by using the long seek bar.

  Adjust volume using the seek bar at the bottom right.

  The application is generally broken down by
  - Album: the cover art for the album
  + Player: Buzz player controller
  + Song List: list of songs
  + PlayerBar: song controls: play, pause, seek, next, previous

# Problem

  This was one of the first projects in Bloc, and as such was a huge learning experience for JavaScript, jQuery, HTML and CSS. Prior to this, my knowledge of these were either sparse (HTML/CSS) or non-existent (JavaScript/jQuery).

# Solution
jQuery, Buzz Player, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Ion Icons, Netlify, GitHub
  This project shows the practical application of several technologies:
  - jQuery
  - Buzz Player
  - JavaScript
  - HTML/CSS
  - Ion Icons
  - Netlify
  - GitHub

# Results

  This was a really good project to get into new development technology.

# Conclusion

  - Leave as-is
